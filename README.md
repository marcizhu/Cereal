> A serialization library for C++ and [C Sharp](https://github.com/marcizhu/Cereal-CSharp/)

Cereal is a header-only library based on [TheCherno](https://github.com/thecherno/)'s
 serialization library for Java. It can be used to serialize almost any kind of data. It's really fast, lightweight and ideal for videogames and other programs where performance and resources are really valuable.
 
The library is really simple to use and fully customizable to fit all your needs. If you make any changes, please open a pull request. We'd love to see your changes!

## Background
This project began a while ago, when both [@raresica1234](https://github.com/raresica1234) and I were developing our own game engines. We needed a way to serialize (that is, to store variables and data structures on files) and deserialize information such as game data, game settings, 3D files and much more.

The main inspiration came from [@TheCherno](https://github.com/TheCherno)'s [serialization library](https://github.com/TheCherno/JavaSerialization). We took the main idea and ported it to C++ with a few improvements.

The entire project was done in less than a week. After that, we started writing the [wiki](https://github.com/marcizhu/Cereal/wiki), writing some automated tests and working on some extra features.

## Install
To install this library, just download it and copy the contents of the `Cereal/Cereal` folder to your include forlder. Then, you only need to include the file `Cereal.h` in your source files.

### From the command line
Just copy the folder `Cereal/Cereal` from this repository to the include folder of your project so that it contains `Cereal.h` and the folder `src`:

```console
marcizhu@linux:~ $ git clone https://github.com/marcizhu/Cereal.git
Cloning into 'Cereal'...
remote: Counting objects: 1031, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (38/38), done.
remote: Total 1031 (delta 17), reused 35 (delta 9), pack-reused 980
Receiving objects: 100% (1031/1031), 1.49 MiB | 678.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (616/616), done.
marcizhu@linux:~ $ cd Cereal
marcizhu@linux:~/Cereal $ mv Cereal/Cereal ../myProject/includes/
marcizhu@linux:~/Cereal $ cd ../myProject/includes/
marcizhu@linux:~/myProject/includes $ ls
Cereal.h     src/
```

### Manually
To manually install the library, click on the green button in the top right and download this repository. After that, copy the folder `Cereal/Cereal` to your include folder.

## Usage
Using this library is pretty straightforward. Just include the file `Cereal.h`in your source file:

```cpp
#include <Cereal.h>
```

After that, all the API will be available inside the `Cereal` namespace. You may include a `using namespace Cereal;` at the top of your source file if you don't like having to type `Cereal::` in front of every class.

### GCC/Clang (Linux/MacOS)
Finally, to compile your file (say `main.cpp`) with Cereal, just include the `-I` modifier followed by the folder where the file `Cereal.h` is located. Also include `-std=c++11` to the compilation command. This is necessary because Cereal uses some C++11 features:

```console
g++ main.cpp -Ipath/to/Cereal -std=c++11 -o output_file
```

### Microsoft Visual Studio 2015/2017 (Windows)
To compile a file with Cereal using visual studio, just add the Cereal folder to the include path. This is done in _Project Settings_ > _Project paths_ > _Include paths_.

Once this is done, your project should compile without any problems!

## Status
This library is actively maintained. We are basically testing the library, improving its features and making sure everything works as intended. More than **8,000 assertions** and 20 tests make sure this library is stable and that no new bugs are introduced.

This tests are executed after each push commit, and the status is displayed as a green tick or red mark next to each commit. You can see the details for each test case.

Right now, the library is ready to be used in any application. As far as we know, it is 100% bug free and fully cross-platform, compiling in Microsoft Windows Vista/7/8/8.1/10, Linux Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/Kali, and MacOS High Sierra.

## API
This library contains different classes. Each class can be used to serialized a different kind of data:

 - [Cereal::Field](https://github.com/marcizhu/Cereal/wiki/Fields): A field just stores a simple data type, like an `int` or a `short`
 - [Cereal::Array](https://github.com/marcizhu/Cereal/wiki/Arrays): An array is a collection of simple data types, for example you can have 10 `floats` stored
 - [Cereal::Object](https://github.com/marcizhu/Cereal/wiki/Objects): Each object contains a name (like all the other data structures) but also it stores fields and arrays (up to 65536 fields plus 65536 arrays)
 - [Cereal::Database](https://github.com/marcizhu/Cereal/wiki/Databases): A database is a collection of objects, each with its own fields and arrays
 - [Cereal::Header](https://github.com/marcizhu/Cereal/wiki/Headers): Headers are optional, but really useful if you want to store more than one database per file. With headers you can have up to 255 databases in a single file!
 - [Cereal::Buffer](https://github.com/marcizhu/Cereal/wiki/Buffers): Buffers are just a helper class that holds serialized data. They can be really useful when reading and writing files.
